      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>David has a ton of hobbies and different ways he likes to spend his time. For work, David is a carpenter. He also occasionally does other remodeling jobs, too, like interior and exterior painting. Together, we have painted every single room in our house a different color. We will get to paint some more when it's time to move out because it's a rental, so we'll have to change everything back to white. David says it's not a waste of time because we're spending time and making memories inside of those walls - and who wants to be surrounded by plain, white walls? When David's not woodworking in the backyard or painting a neighbors house down the road, he enjoys riding bikes and taking Juneau and Bear for long walks at the many dog parks near his home. David also has started traveling with me and my family when we take vacations. Below is a picture of us on our last trip to Puerto Rico.
