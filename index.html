        <h2>About the Site</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to introduce you to my dear partner, David Merrick. David is an old soul and is one of those people who makes you feel like you've been friends with him all your life, even if you just met 5 minutes ago. Sometimes I feel like everytime we go out in public, he runs into somebody he knows and they're always excited to see him. David is always down for anything, no matter what it is, and he lets his creativity flow through everything he does. He is sometimes creative to a fault and occasionally has problems staying on task if the work is too mundane. He may not think so, but I think that he deserves a website to showcase his awesome self!</p>
