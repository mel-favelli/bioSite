        <h2>About the Site</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to introduce you to my dear partner, David Merrick. David is an old soul and is one of those people who makes you feel like you've been friends with him all your life, even if you just met 5 minutes ago. David is always down for anything and he lets his creativity flow through everything he does in his day-to-day life. He may not think so, but I think that he deserves a website to showcase his awesome self!</p>
